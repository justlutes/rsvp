            It all started with a “Someday…” Well, someday has happened and here we are 10 years later about to become husband and wife. The story begins with extremely high hopes for an extra special Christmas present last year. 
            When that didn’t happen, Kyle quickly said “I can’t be predictable.” Well, predictable he was not, ladies and gentleman. We arrived home early from work on the Friday before New Year’s Eve, and Kyle said 
            “Let’s have everyone over to our house tomorrow night!” For those of you that don’t know, Kyle doesn’t plan ANYTHING, but unknowing to me at the time he had surely been up to something.

            Unsuspecting as ever, I quickly planned a menu, and out we went grocery shopping to host our families the next evening for some NYE fun! I have to admit, at this point I was still not on to him yet. 
            The next day we did the typical things you do before guests come to your house: Cleaning, food prep, photo op etc. Kyle was not acting the least bit strange, 
            so I was trying not to get excited and suspect something - although my best friend Crystal was surely on to him at this point. Dinner was made, drinks were poured, 
            games had begun, and off we went on the adventure to the greatest night of my life.

            Nobody was acting the least bit out of sorts, so I was still unsuspecting about whether my wish was going to come true or not. Upon a glass refill, I noticed the bottle of champagne we bought for the 
            midnight celebration was missing…questions I was curiously asking ONLY myself and Crystal: “Where is the bottle”, “what happened to it”, “where did it go” “who drank it”, “this is weird”? 
            Well, let’s just say, then I was on to him 75%, but had absolutely no idea when or if this was actually going to happen. At 11:50pm out came confetti cannons, and glasses of champagne, 
            and everyone was ready for the countdown. Here we go 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 MIDNIGHT - all the confetti cannons popped and when I finally turned around among the confetti, Kyle was on his knee and asked me the question 
            I had waited 10 years for! Of course I said YES! Our house was a disaster, and we still to this day are finding confetti, but it was the greatest night of my life!

            P.S. The answer to the biggest mystery of the night….the missing champagne bottle! It went to my parents’ house, along with breakfast and Kyle to ask for their permission and for them to be in on his plan. 
            Kyle Douglas, you amaze me – I love you.
